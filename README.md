I used this project as a way to learn C for my systems programming class. It definatley succeeded at preparing me more than it did at interpreting Lisp. I stopped because I didn't feel like implementing a hash table while on my vacation in Europe last summer. It can read block statements and mathematical expressions. As of now, I don't think it builds though...
