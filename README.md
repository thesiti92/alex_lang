I used this project to learn C for my systems programming class. It definitely succeeded at preparing me more than it did at interpreting Lisp. I stopped because I didn't feel like implementing a variable lookup table while out of the country on vacation last summer. It can read block statements and mathematical expressions from a file. As of now, I don't think it builds though...
